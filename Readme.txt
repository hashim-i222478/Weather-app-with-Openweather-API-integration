- The project is a weather application that uses open weather api to get the weather data and 
displayes it dynamically through DOM Manipulation on the screen.
- Secondly the app contains a chat bot that answers weather related queries by sending a request to the open weather api and fetches the response and displays the result.
if the query is not about the weather then the chat bot fetches the response from the Gemini Api
and answers the queries of the person.
